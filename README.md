# Clashborn

Clashborn is a school project where [Mixemand](https://github.com/Mixemand) and I
combine software-centric computer gaming with the real world.

The concept centers around two RFID readers that scan custom character tokens,
which are then summoned in-game to fight each other.

The art style for the game is intentionally simplistic, drawing inspiration from
games like [Pizza Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/),
totally not because none of us know how to draw
